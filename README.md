# Protein Database
PDB files for proteins we are interested in that consist of the following:
- Purely monomeric proteins (i.e, no ligands, hemes, dna, etc.)
- <500 amino acids in length
- (anything else here...)

Idealy we would have useful scripts (i.e., index mapping, jackhammer, etc.) on here as well.

## To-do: ##
- add pdbs
- automate jackhammer integration to extract sequences from pdb and make msa
- automate index mapping and include an list of maps readily available
